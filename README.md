# bmax_shmup_level_editor

A simple level-editor for my shoot'em'up game project on the amiga. I don't want edit the level-maps within the amiga
emulator environment and I don't want use Tiled, so I started my own level-editor.

you can compile this code with the BlitzMAX version 1.5x or you can also use the newer version of BlitzMAX NG.

Keyboard / Mouse shortcuts:

 * cursor-keys left/right = scroll levelmap
 * key-c					 = clear level data
 * key-s					 = save level data
 * key-l					 = load level data
 * key-g					 = toggle tile-grid
 * key-escape			 = exit level-editor
 * left-mouse button		 = set tile (selection from the tile-selection screen)
 * right-mouse button	 = clear tile with id #0
 * middle-mouse button	 = open tile-selection screen (left-mouse-button for selecting a tile for editing)
