# bmax_shmup_level_editor

A simple level-editor for my shoot'em'up game project on the amiga. I don't want edit the level-maps within the amiga
emulator environment and I don't want use Tiled, so I started my own level-editor.

It's still in development. You can compile the code with the BlitzMAX version 1.5x or you can also use the newer version of BlitzMAX NG.

Level data will be loaded/saved in the folder "data/lvl" as binary data.

Keyboard / Mouse shortcuts:

 * cursor-keys left/right 	 = scroll levelmap
 * key-c					           = clear level data
 * key-s					           = save level data
 * key-l					           = load level data
 * key-g					           = toggle tile-grid
 * key-m                     = save screenshot (screenshot.png)
 * key-escape			 	         = exit level-editor
 * left-mouse button		     = set tile (selection from the tile-selection screen)
 * right-mouse button	 	     = clear tile with id #0
 * middle-mouse button	  	 = open tile-selection screen (left-mouse-button for selecting a tile for editing)
 
 amiga graphics mode for the game:
 =================================
 * game-resolution: 320 x 208 pixel
